# About

This repo contains a Xojo project used for experimenting with different techniques for storing a large number of characters.

It was born out of the need from a text editor project where I needed the most efficient and fastest way to store text and access / alter characters at varying positions within the body of text.

Surprisingly, using good old arrays is faster than my implementation of a gap buffer.
